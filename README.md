# Extract_Transfer_Load_Project

For this ETL mini project, we worked as a team to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database where queries can easily be pulled for visualizations or insights.
